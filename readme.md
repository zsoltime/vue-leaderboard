#Day 1 of My Vue.js Challenge

This is the first day of my [Vue.js challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/vue-basic-challenge), building the Free Code Camp leaderboard app.

I've decided to use `div`s instead of a `table` to make the board responsive.

## User Stories

 - [x] I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
 - [x] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
 - [x] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

##Â Next Steps

- Add a user card modal displaying user ranks
